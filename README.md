# Learn to Build Powerful Generative AI Applications (2025 Course)

Welcome to the **hands-on 2025 course** on building Generative AI applications! In this course, you will learn how to harness modern tools like Node.js, the OpenAI API, LangChain, and TypeScript to create intelligent applications. Each lecture provides practical examples and code to help you build real-world AI projects. Ready to get started? Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Key Technologies

* **Node.js** ‚Äì JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend applications
* **OpenAI API** (ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E, Whisper) ‚Äì AI models for text, image, and speech processing
* **LangChain** ‚Äì Framework for developing applications with large language models
* **TypeScript** ‚Äì Typed superset of JavaScript for more robust code
* **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) ‚Äì Full-stack development
* **Express.js** ‚Äì Web framework for Node.js to build REST APIs
* **REST APIs** ‚Äì Standard interface for communication between services
* **Vector Databases** ‚Äì Databases optimized for AI search and similarity (e.g. Pinecone, Milvus)
* **AI Agents** ‚Äì Autonomous programs that can interact with tools and APIs

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js (v14 or later) and npm installed.
* **MERN Stack Knowledge**: Familiarity with basic MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js is assumed.
* **Git**: (Optional) For cloning the repository; you can also download the ZIP.

### Windows

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName.git
cd YourRepoName
```

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment variables:

Each lecture folder contains a `.env.example` file. Copy this file to create your own `.env`:

* Using Command Prompt:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

* Using PowerShell or Git Bash:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in your API keys and configurations.

#### Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Or use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### macOS / Linux

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName.git
cd YourRepoName
```

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your configuration.

#### Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Or:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Configuration

Each lecture or project directory includes a `.env.example` file with placeholder values. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`. Update it with your own credentials like `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Running the App

```bash
npm install   # Install dependencies
npm start     # Start the server
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Coming Soon: Project 1 ‚Äì AI Chatbot

This project will guide you through:

* Designing conversation flows
* Integrating LangChain
* Using ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E, or Whisper
* Deploying locally or in the cloud

**Stay tuned!**

## Future Updates

We plan to add:

* Docker and Kubernetes support
* More real-world AI projects
* CI/CD automation
